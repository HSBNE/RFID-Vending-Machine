# RFID Vending Machine

This Arduino firmware runs our RFID enabled vending machines and integrates with our portal software [Member Matters](https://membermatters.org).

You'll need v5.x of the Arduino JSON library as this firmware has not been updated to support v6.x yet.

You'll need to configure the firmware to connect to your WiFi network and MemberMatters instance, as well as the port used to trigger the dispense.
